**Assignment 2 Recap**
--------------

**Notes:**
Added tooltips to the barchart visualization for A+


Created one bar chart for one variable with even spacing on axes


Created examples in Tableau for all the charts as well. I actually started with those because it was easier than p5.js


I used a logarithmic scale (log10) on the second graph because the scale is skewed due to the massive range


Added a annotation to heatmap to draw attention to the masnu family of malware which has the highest I/O


I wasn't able to add the tooltip into all the charts b/c it was hard to get working on the heatmap 


On the heatmap I have at least 7 rows (I have 11 rows) and the data is aggregateable by averaging across all the malware samples


    that are in the family category (fileInfector for example) - this should qualify for the 95 criteria if I understand correctly
